# ✈️ FareFinder – Detect Potential Airline Pricing Mistakes with Python

**FareFinder** is a Python-based tool designed to help spot potential **airfare pricing mistakes** or **unusually low fares** by scanning flight data and identifying routes priced significantly below typical thresholds.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Scan flight routes and dates for unusually low fares
- 💸 Flag deals that fall below a configurable price threshold
- 🧠 Designed to help identify error fares or hidden deals
- 📝 Flexible input: CSV files, scraped data, or custom APIs
- ⚙️ Easy to customize and extend

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `requests` and/or `pandas` libraries (depending on your data source)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔑 Setup

1. Collect or scrape flight pricing data.  
   - You can use tools like BeautifulSoup or Selenium to pull prices from public airline/aggregator sites (respect their terms of use).
   - Or use a CSV file with columns like `origin`, `destination`, `date`, `price`.

2. Modify the script to read your data source and set a **price threshold** to flag cheap routes.

---

## 🧪 Usage

Example (if using a CSV file as input):

```python
from farefinder import find_deals

find_deals("flights.csv", max_price=150)
```

Example CSV file:

```csv
origin,destination,date,price
ATL,LAX,2024-06-10,312
ATL,LAX,2024-06-11,92
ATL,JFK,2024-06-10,178
```

Script output:

```
🔥 Potential error fare: ATL ➡️ LAX on 2024-06-11 for $92
```

## 📌 Notes

- This project is **framework-agnostic** – you decide how you want to fetch or provide flight data.
